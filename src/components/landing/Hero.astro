        Dear World
      </h1>
      <p class="mt-8 text-sunset-earthwood">
        Dear World is a global fundraising initiative launched in response to
        the recent earthquake that has severely impacted communities across
        Myanmar. The objective of this project is to raise international
        support, as the domestic population is already under significant
        economic hardship and unable to contribute to large-scale recovery
        efforts. In recognition of each donation, contributors will receive
        curated digital creative pieces captured by local artists and creatives.
        These images serve as a token of appreciation for standing in solidarity
        with those affected.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-8 text-sunset-earthwood">
        This fundraiser features 25 selected photographs from *If Only I Could
        Tell You*â€”a deeply personal collection of images taken during Erikâ€™s
        time in the United States. The photobook, still ongoing and shared under
        the name erikfilmsxo, was created to share the experiences he never had
        the chance to tell his late father, who passed away shortly after his
        return to Myanmar.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-8 text-sunset-earthwood">
        Through Fund With 25, these photographs now serve a new purpose: to
        provide relief and support to those affected by the earthquake. 100% of
        the proceeds will go to trusted earthquake relief efforts. Every
        purchase and share helps bring essential aid to those in need.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-8 text-red-600">
        The photos displayed are in low resolution for preview purposes. The
        purchased photos will be provided in high resolution.
